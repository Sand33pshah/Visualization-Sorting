# Visualization Sorting

Welcome to Visualization Sorting!  
This project helps users visually understand how core sorting algorithms work through interactive, step-by-step animations.

---

## âœ¨ Overview

**Visualization Sorting** is an interactive JavaScript web project that animates sorting algorithms in real time. Users can choose a sorting algorithm, set array size and speed, and watch as the algorithm sorts the data with clear, color-coded visuals.

---

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Algorithms Implemented**:  
  - Bubble Sort  
  - Selection Sort  
  - Insertion Sort  
- **Step-by-Step Animation**:  
  See every comparison and swap, highlighted in color.
- **User Controls**:  
  Change array size, adjust sorting speed, shuffle data, and select algorithms.
- **Intuitive Interface**:  
  Start, pause, and reset sorting at any time.

## ðŸ§© Project Structure

```
Visualization-Sorting/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html        # Entry point and UI
â”œâ”€â”€ style.css         # Visual styles for bars and controls
â”œâ”€â”€ script.js         # Sorting logic and visualization
```

## ðŸ’¡ How It Works

- The sorting algorithms are implemented in `script.js`.
- The visualizer creates an array of bars, representing numbers.
- As sorting progresses, bars are highlighted (yellow for comparison, red for swaps, steelblue for sorted/default).
- Speed and array size are adjustable via sliders.
- Users interact through the controls in `index.html`.

## ðŸŽ“ What You Learn

- The operational steps of Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort.
- How sorting algorithms compare elements and rearrange values.
- The visual difference in methods and efficiency between algorithms.
- How simple UI interactions can help teach algorithmic logic.

## Explored Areas

- **Sorting Fundamentals**: Bubble, Selection, and Insertion Sortâ€”all with visualization.
- **Algorithm Animation**: Translating sorting steps into visual changes for learning.
- **JavaScript DOM Manipulation**: Using JS to create and update visual elements on the page.
- **User Experience in Learning Algorithms**: Interactive controls for better understanding.
