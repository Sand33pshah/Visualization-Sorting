## ✨ Overview

**Visualization Sorting** is an interactive project designed to visually demonstrate how different sorting algorithms work. By animating the sorting process step-by-step, this project helps users understand the inner mechanics of algorithms like Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, and more.

Whether you’re a student, educator, or developer, this visualization tool offers an engaging way to learn, teach, or simply enjoy the beauty of sorting algorithms in action.

## 🚀 Features

- **Multiple Sorting Algorithms**: Visualize Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick, and Heap Sort.
- **Step-by-Step Animation**: Watch algorithms unfold in real-time with clear, colorful highlights.
- **User Interaction**: Change the array size, speed of visualization, or shuffle the data.
- **Intuitive Interface**: Easy-to-use controls for starting, pausing, and resetting sorts.
- **Algorithm Comparison**: Observe performance differences between algorithms.

## 💡 How It Works

Each sorting algorithm is broken down into visual steps. As elements are compared and swapped, the visualization highlights the changes, allowing users to follow the algorithm's logic in real time. Users can control the speed, size of the array, and choose which algorithm to visualize.

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes

- Grasp the operational steps of popular sorting algorithms.
- Visually compare efficiency and complexity.
- Gain hands-on experience with algorithmic thinking.
